        <p>Game progression is based on the points that the players gain from destroying the enemies, the greater the number of points the players have the more difficult the game will become as
           the enemy spawn rate will increase. As the players have their own scoring system, the points used to decide the game progression, is based on the player with the most points.

        <h2 id = design-title>Inspriation</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for the gameplay for this game came from two classics, Space Invaders and Asteriods. The use of the cannons within the game that the player will control
          was taken from the milsile ship from Space invaders, and the randomness of the enemies was taken from Asteroids.

          The art style of the game was taken from the game Cloudpunk.

    <p>
     The entire game will be played within the one scene. Within this scene, the players will be displayed their health, lives and their score. Enemies will spawn from the top of the screen
    and move downwards to the city which will line the bottom of the screen. The players will be able to move left and right, and will be placed above the city.
